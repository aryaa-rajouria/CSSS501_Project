# ANALYSIS 

fdata <- read.csv('/Users/katherine/fdata2.csv')

# Primary analysis 

# QUESTIONS - Some of these covariates seem closely related (e.g., those related to language)
# Can we have these together

# 1. How do the following psycho-social factors affect self-rated physical health? 
  
#  M1a: Elevated depressive symptoms (binary)

m1a <- glm(eds ~ age + gender + doc_status + income_family + MARRIED + migrant_2 + race + edu_highest + dom_lang + eng_read, data=fdata, family=binomial)
summary(m1a)

# Notes: Education substantially improves fit, MARRIED (instead of married.LT)
# , income_family (instead of income), eng_speak (instead of eng_read)
# and migrant_2 (instead of migrant_1) creates slightly better fit. edu_any is not found

# Results: Reported at p<0.05

# Lesser probability of have elevated depressive symptoms if...
# Black, Other, or White (compared to indigenous)

# Higher probability of having elevated depressive symptoms
# Having a family income of 9,999-17,499 (compared to reference category of 17,999-29,999), 
# Woman (compared to man), 
# Having a primary school education (compared to some college)
# Having a higher english reading skill

# M1b: Elevated psychological demands (binary)

m1b <- glm(epd ~ age + gender + doc_status + income + MARRIED + migrant_2 + race + edu_highest + dom_lang + eng_read, data=fdata, family=binomial)
summary(m1b)

# Note: Personal income is better than family income here, married.LT better than MARRIED

# Lesser probability of having elevating pyschological demands
# Being settled or shuttled (compared to FTC)
# Having spanish as dominant language
# Being Black, compared to indigenous

# Higher probability of having elevated psychological demands
# Having a personal income of 9,999-17,499 (compared to 17,999-29,999)

# M1c: Low control (binary)

m1c <- glm(lowcont ~ age + gender + doc_status + income + MARRIED + migrant_1 + race + edu_highest + eng_read, data=fdata, family=binomial)
summary(m1c)

# Note: MARRIED (instead of married.LT), eng_read (instead of eng_speak), 
# income (instead of income_family), migrant_1 (instead of migrant_2), 
# eliminating dom_lang create better fit

# Lesser probability of having low control
# Being married (compared to not married)
# Being a non-migrant (compared to FTC)

# Higher probability of having low control
# Having other work authoriation or being unauthorized (compared to citizen)
# Having an income of 2,500-9,999 or 9,999-17,499 (compared to 17,499-29,999)
# Being Black (compared to indigenous)

# M1d: Job strain (binary or ordered categorical)
# JOB STRAIN NOT RUNNING
