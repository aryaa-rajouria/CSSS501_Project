# CSSS510_Project: Understanding Farmworker Health Using the Stress Process Framework


Special attention has been given to farm worker health in extant literature on the basis of their
“greater exposure to toxic chemicals, work-related injuries, and other occupational hazards (Variyam
and Mishra 2005:369).” A seminal article by Variyam and Mishra (2005) attempts to shift this skewed
focus by examining farm worker health holistically, namely, via the deployment of a comprehensive list
of health indicators (e.g., chronic health conditions, overall health status, etc.) present in data from the
1997-2002 National Health Interview Survey. While the study offers a valuable snapshot of farm worker
well-being, a number of limitations exist: it likely underestimates seasonal and migrant farm workers; it
does not take farm workers’ mental health into account; and does not consider farm workers’ potential
differential access to health resources or legal status.

Our analyses using the 2009-2010 wave of National Agricultural Workers Survey (NAWS) merged
with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) mental health supplement seeks
to address these gaps. We critically examine the factors that both mediate and moderate the mental
health of farm workers in the U.S. More specifically, we ask the following main research questions: How
does legal status affect farm workers’ mental health? How does social assistance moderate this effect?
Before conducting this analysis, it is important to survey existing literature beginning with the
conceptual framework that guides our inquiry followed by a review of extant research on farm worker
health.
